<h1>down the winding road, part 1</h1>
<p>By midnight</p>
<p>It gets old sometimes, waiting for things to happen. The skies break and mend themselves again, and things stay the same. </p>
<p>A pond ripples in the forest, ever-clear and shimmering. Its waters reflect my face - or perhaps it belongs to someone else now.</p>
<p>A rock breaks the surface, thrown by my own hand. I cannot bear its image.</p>
<p>Sunlight filters through the trees, beaming from the setting sun. It shines on my face, though there is nobody here to see it.</p>
<p>I rise from my place at the water's edge, and slowly begin down the road.</p>
