<h1>Tincture</h1>

<p>I never really liked church</p>
<p>even though the stained glass was beautiful</p>
<p>and shone in the sun from angles zero to three sixty</p>
<p>tanning our faces when we left service and </p>
<p>banishing the darkness, or so the minister said.</p>
<p>I never really liked church,</p>
<p>even though the youth group had little finger snacks</p>
<p>and I felt like a rich lady with a feathered coat</p>
<p>that was just large enough to hide the bruises in.</p>
<p>Like pinpricks from a needle,</p>
<p>if needles could talk and move and see</p>
<p>and crush and grab </p>
<p>and hate; intense like a blaze</p>
<p>licking up at me with a roiling anger because I wasn't so easy to control</p>
<p>gripping me, setting my nerves off like fireworks</p>
<p>leaving marks like the associated strontium scarlet</p>
<p>blooming across my skin and blocking out the sun,</p>
<p>leaving me in the darkness that was supposed to have gone. </p>
<p>I never really liked church,</p>
<p>and there's a very certain freedom one gets from leaving</p>
<p>holding a shard of the symbol withing my palm, </p>
<p>sable, gules</p>
<p>now obscured by my knuckles and smashed between my fingers,</p>
<p>glass being carried away by the torrent of red</p>
<p>blood without the body.</p>
