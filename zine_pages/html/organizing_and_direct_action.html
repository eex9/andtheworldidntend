<h1>Organizing and Direct Action</h1>
<p>By midnight</p>
<h4>What is direct action?</h4>
<p>Direct action is any action that cuts out the middle man and solves problems directly. It doesn't petition the
    authorities or rely on external institutions, and it doesn't ask for permission.</p>
<h4>Why use direct action?</h4>
<p>Absolute power corrupts absolutely. While there’s no reason the strategies of voting and direct action can’t both be
    applied together, the problem comes when people see voting as their <em>only</em> method of change. Voting will work
    for small, short-term change, but it doesn't have the power to significantly change the status quo. Government,
    despite appearances, is not actually open to significant change via voting - it's actually the opposite. Voting
    ensures that social change must be slow and gradual, working within the confines of the systems provided to us.
    Direct action allows for rapid, radical change that wouldn't be possible under purview of the state.</p>
<h4>How do you organize direct action?</h4>
<p>Direct action isn't necessarily violent - and in our case, it probably shouldn't be. Any type of protest is direct
    action, whether that be picketing while on strike or marching against a new rule or law. </p>
