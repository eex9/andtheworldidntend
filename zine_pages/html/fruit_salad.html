<h1>Fruit Salad</h1>
<p>By SKYR4Z3R</p>
<p>fruit salad</p>
<p>I push it around my plate with a fork</p>
<p>hearing it scrape and wishing it was so simple</p>
<p>as to put the tomatoes and mangos in my mouth</p>
<p>but the mangoes are fuzzy and the former have stems,</p>
<p>and no one seems to care save for me.</p>
<p>what kind of fruit salad has tomatoes in it, anyway? </p>
