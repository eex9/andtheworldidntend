<h1>down the winding road, part 3</h1>
<p>By midnight</p>
<p>The skies mend themselves again. It's almost a miracle, watching the world walk the same journey I do.</p>
<p>I can see where I journey to - or at least I believe I can. I have a long ways yet to walk, but I know where I will be when I am there.</p>
<p>A small creature crosses my path. It is the first soul I have seen since starting my journey. </p>
<p>Starlight pours into the valley in front of me as I rest again. I laugh, and I miss those that would enjoy my company on this journey.</p>
<p>I take my final step on this journey of mine. I am almost a child again - one of the sun, and the moon, and the stars. I sit, and the horizon stretches infinitely in front of me.</p>
