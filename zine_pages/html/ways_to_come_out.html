<li>Kahoot</li>
</ol>
<p>Make a kahoot. Doesn’t matter the topic. The more unrelated, the better. At the very end, add the question: “What is my sexuality.” Sit back and watch.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Host a gender reveal party</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not your fault they assumed you were talking about a baby. </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Cover everything they own in rainbow wrapping paper</li>
</ol>
<p>Remind them that you are a gift and it is about time they started treating you like one.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Set the forest on fire.</li>
</ol>
<p>You all saw that one gender reveal party. If they can do it so can you.</p>
