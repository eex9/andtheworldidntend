1. Hide and go seek
Step one: Buy a 100+ pride pins. 
Step two: Proceed to hide said pins in increasingly inconvenient places around your house.
Step three: profit
Additional step four: after about 50 or so pins have been found, tell them you hid exactly one more than you actually did. 

2. Kahoot
Make a kahoot. Doesn’t matter the topic. The more unrelated, the better. At the very end, add the question: “What is my sexuality.” Sit back and watch.

3. Host a gender reveal party
It’s not your fault they assumed you were talking about a baby. 

4.  Cover everything they own in rainbow wrapping paper
Remind them that you are a gift and it is about time they started treating you like one.

5. Set the forest on fire.
You all saw that one gender reveal party. If they can do it so can you.
