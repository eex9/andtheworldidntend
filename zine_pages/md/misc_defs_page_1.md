title: Miscellaneous Definitions

Definitions, what do we mean when we talk about things? That is an ancient question highly reliant on who, where and when you are. The following definitions are highly subject to change and may mean different things to different people, these just seem like the best ones. 

- Third gender: a traditional or ceremonial role held by someone who is not viewed as male or female by the society around them.

- Eunuch: blanket term for a third gender individual in an ancient near eastern society. The word eunuch is what is used in translations but this definition is what historians generally agree on.

- Sex: the thing on your birth certificate. 

- Gender: whether someone identifies as male, female, neither, both, in between or something 
else, may align with sex or may not. (can be argued as a social construct) 

- Transgender: when someone's gender (what your brain perceives you as) does not align with their sex (what you were assigned at birth). (around 5% of the population, exact numbers are not known and different studies say different things, this also uses what the authors call the left handed theorem which uses the most recent generation as a basis for information on population trends).

- Cisgender: someone whose gender identity aligns with the gender they were assigned at birth.
