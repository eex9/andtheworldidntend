where everything feels like it is choking you and it is loud and all your memories bleed into each other until all of it is a brown muddle and you have just lost a week, a month, half a year of your life but you are still here, for the first time in who knows how long taking a breath and finally feeling the air hit your lungs. And the White Cedar narrator says I’ll be reborn, someday, someday / if I wait long enough and with the faith of someone who has played tug of war with their lifeline held in the hand of God and found that He did not let go, says you can’t tell me what my spirit tells me isn’t true, can you? / Trans Youth is an album about almost slipping away from the world and that is why it is a sad album and Trans Youth is about that not happening, at least not today / I love my friends but am frequently lonely and being trans sometimes feels like being in a very large building where there is no one and just space, and being trans and retreating frequently into my closet is like being in a panopticon prison where the wall facing the outside is glass and I watch the people on the street and wonder when the warden goes to sleep, if the warden goes to sleep at all / I am familiar with the concept of living for other people but very soon I think, it will be just me and the liner notes of Trans Youth say this is an album of people living for themselves not out of any love for themselves because overall they are not always the greatest people sometimes they are Judas Iscariot and sometimes people just find them strange too strange or too sad to bear or hopeless and it is hard to love someone you feel you cannot help, I know, but it doesn’t matter and Amy the first song on the album says just stay alive, whatever you need to do. Just stay alive / If I am reading this to you, if you are reading this, I am still here. / And you see, this is a great victory.
