#### What is direct action?
Direct action is any action that cuts out the middle man and solves problems directly. It doesn't petition the authorities or rely on external institutions, and it doesn't ask for permission.
#### Why use direct action?
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. While there’s no reason the strategies of voting and direct action can’t both be applied together, the problem comes when people see voting as their *only* method of change. Voting will work for small, short-term change, but it doesn't have the power to significantly change the status quo. Government, despite appearances, is not actually open to significant change via voting - it's actually the opposite. Voting ensures that social change must be slow and gradual, working within the confines of the systems provided to us. Direct action allows for rapid, radical change that wouldn't be possible under purview of the state.
#### How do you organize direct action?
Direct action isn't necessarily violent - and in our case, it probably shouldn't be. Any type of protest is direct action, whether that be picketing while on strike or marching against a new rule or law. 
1. Figure out who you're working with.
	- It's almost always easier to organize when you have people to bounce ideas off of.
2. Figure out your plan of action.
	- What are you trying to do? Is it a protest? Are you trying to communicate new ideas?
	- Make backup plans. Things can always go wrong, or take a turn for the unexpected.
3. Figure out promotion
	- How will people find out about this?
		- Posters
		- Word of mouth
		- Newspapers
		- Other events
4. Do the event!
	- Make sure to communicate with the people you're working with! Just because you got here doesn't mean you're home free yet.
5. Cleanup
	- Physical cleanup
	- Meet with your team to discuss what went well and what lessons can be learned
