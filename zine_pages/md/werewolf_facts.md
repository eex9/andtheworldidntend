1: A werewolf cannot be distinguished from people who are not werewolves by their appearance. "Oh!" You might say, pointing to a random person you don't even know the name of, "that person is a werewolf! They have hairy legs!" No, that's just a person. While werewolves have a tendency to have more hair on their bodies, not every person with hairy bodies is a werewolf, and frankly? It's none of your fucking business. 

2: Werewolves do not choose to be werewolves. It is not something they can control. While some werewolves may choose to never transform, this usually ends up with their quality of life going down severely. Not transforming every full moon hurts. A werewolf who cannot or is not allowed to transform may fall into depression or act in self destructive ways, especially as they may feel that their family and friends may abandon them if they transform. 

3: Werewolves transforming every full moon does not hurt anyone. There are many stereotypes and prejudices out there that werewolves are predatory monsters. These are not true! Many people are afraid of what they do not understand, and werewolves are some of the most misunderstood people out there. Most werewolves are just normal people, and they retain their personality and values when they transform. 

4: if one of your friends or family or children has come out to you as a werewolf, they are still the same person they were before. You do not need to grieve them. They are still there. The only change is that they have decided to be truer to themselves. 
5: being a werewolf is more common than you realize. You might have coworkers who are werewolves. The person standing in front of you in line at the store might be a werewolf. Some people who you pass in the halls might be werewolves. You will not be able to tell, and that's okay. Werewolves existing do not harm you, and everyone is just trying to get by. 

6: Werewolves are not a new thing. Werewolves have existed in folklore and been honored in cultures all around the world for thousands of years. They are not an invention of social media, or of the "radical left." They have always existed. 

7: If you couldn't already tell, all trans people are werewolves.
