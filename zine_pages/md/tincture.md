I never really liked church
even though the stained glass was beautiful
and shone in the sun from angles zero to three sixty
tanning our faces when we left service and 
banishing the darkness, or so the minister said.

I never really liked church,
even though the youth group had little finger snacks
and I felt like a rich lady with a feathered coat
that was just large enough to hide the bruises in.

Like pinpricks from a needle,
if needles could talk and move and see
and crush and grab 
and hate; intense like a blaze
licking up at me with a roiling anger because I wasn't so easy to control
gripping me, setting my nerves off like fireworks
leaving marks like the associated strontium scarlet
blooming across my skin and blocking out the sun,
leaving me in the darkness that was supposed to have gone. 

I never really liked church,
and there's a very certain freedom one gets from leaving
holding a shard of the symbol withing my palm, 
sable, gules
now obscured by my knuckles and smashed between my fingers,
glass being carried away by the torrent of red
blood without the body.
